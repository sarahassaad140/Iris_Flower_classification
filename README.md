# Iris_Flower_classification
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on classifying the species of Iris flowers based on their morphological characteristics using machine learning techniques. 
The Iris dataset, widely used in the field of machine learning, contains data on three different Iris speciesâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project leverages features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to predict the species of Iris flowers.

In this project, we apply data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation to build a robust Random Forest Classifier for accurate classification. The project also includes visualizations to explore relationships between features and evaluate model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to provide insights into the classification of Iris flowers, offering a solid understanding of feature importance, model evaluation, and the ability to distinguish between different species of Iris flowers
